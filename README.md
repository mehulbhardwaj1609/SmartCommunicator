# SmartCommunicator

Creating an Android app that facilitates communication between disabled people and others is a great idea. Here are some possible features that could be included in the app to address the needs of the deaf, dumb, and blind:

1. Support for sign language: The app can include a feature that recognizes and translates sign language into text or voice. This would allow deaf users to communicate with people who don't know sign language.

2. Voice recognition: For dumb people, the app can incorporate voice recognition technology that transcribes speech into text. This would enable them to communicate more easily with others.

3. Text-to-speech: For blind people, the app can have a text-to-speech feature that reads out messages received or typed by the user. This would allow them to communicate with others without having to rely on someone to read out the messages to them.

4. Large font size and high contrast: The app can also have a user
